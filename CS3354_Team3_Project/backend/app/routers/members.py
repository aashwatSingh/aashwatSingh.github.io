@description: Project people management. Owners and managers can invite existing ProjectForge users,
    remove members (optionally handing all of that person's unfinished tasks to someone else in the same
    database transaction) and change roles. A project can never be left without an owner: demoting or
    removing the last owner is refused with "Project must have at least one owner". Only an owner may grant
    or take away the owner role. Every change notifies the affected person, and the new role applies on
    their very next request because permissions are re-checked server-side each time.
@traces: SE-FR-30, SE-NFR-11, UC-19, UC-20
